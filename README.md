# Adaptive-Cruise-Controlled-Car
In this project, made an Adaptive Cruise Controlled Car using Arduino Mega, Ultrasonic Sensors, IR sensors and Motor driver. The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Edge Detection technology, which minimises the driver's driving problems. The ACC system on the road essentially supports driving modes and manages the vehicle's acceleration and deceleration in order to maintain a fixed speed or avoid an accident.
